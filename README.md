# Description

> Walking rocks will publish their top 6 walks every month with walks included that will suit all abilities from beginners, familes to experienced walkers.
# Deployment and Demo
Website has been deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://nfox13.github.io/MS2--Interactive-Frontend-Development/).
# Wireframe
The wireframe was designed using [Wireframe.cc]( https://wireframe.cc/) links to the original version can be found below:

# UX
I have opted for a simple design that I feel gets the information to the client effectively and directs them to the areas that they need to go.
- The one page design should reduce confusion and give the user a pleasant, stressfree experience.

In order to improve user experience and website loading speed, I have compressed the images using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) and the reduction in image size has been 34% and 29%.

![Website Speed Test Results](assets/images/speedTest.jpg)
During testing my google maps API loads initially then stops and gives an error, I have tried to rectify this but unfortunately I did not have the time to get this working correctly before my submission deadline.
To improve on the app with more time I would tidy up the card images and hero logo. I will play around with the walking rocks logo and make it more sleek and blend it in to the hero logo.
Most importantly, I would rectify the issues with the google maps API. 
HTML and CSS has been tested using W3C validator and the javascript has been tested using jshint.com
