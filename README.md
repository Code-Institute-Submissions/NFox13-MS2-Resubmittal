# Description
*Walking rocks are a fictitious group*
> Walking rocks is a walking group set up to encourage people to get out walking and get more activity in their lifestyle.
> The website was created for people who are interested in walking and would be interested in joining the Walking rocks group.
> As more people are becoming increasingly health conscious, this website would like to inform people where there are suitable walks where they can walk safely and even meet other people from the group. 
> Walking rocks will publish their top 6 walks every month with walks included that will suit all abilities from beginners, familes to experienced walkers.
> Annual membership entitles members to receive updates and join the group on an annual group walk.
# Deployment and Demo
Website has been deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://nfox13.github.io/MS2-Resubmittal/).
- On deployment of the website I realised that my images would not load when deployed so I had to rectify the image paths.
# Wireframe
The wireframe was designed using [Wireframe.cc]( https://wireframe.cc/) links to the original version can be found below:

# UX
I have opted for a simple design that I feel gets the information to the client effectively and directs them to the areas that they need to go.
- The one page design should reduce confusion and give the user a pleasant, stressfree experience.
# Responsiveness
I have tested the responsiveness of the webpage manually using the developer tools inspect option but on deployment I tested the responsiveness again using [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/).

# Compress images
In order to improve user experience and website loading speed, I have compressed the images using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) and the reduction in image size has been 34% and 29% which reduced my images by 2711kb.

# Visual Identity
The Logo and colour were created with nature in mind. Walking rocks as a name has walking and rocks in it which are also keeping to the theme. The people that we expect to join our group are interesting in the earth, health, nature and wellbeing and I feel the earthy colours, name and logo add to this.
